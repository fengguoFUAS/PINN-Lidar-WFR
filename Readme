# On Wind Directions Estimated by Nacelle Lidar UnderDifferent Reconstruction Methods, Wind Energy
# https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/we.70098

# Note: This code is intended for demonstration purposes only.
# It has been tested only for the non-yawed case and does not account for sequential lidar scanning. 

# Please install the dependenies in the requirements.txt first.

# Hope this code is helpful for your investigation.
# Please cite this paper if you find this code helpful for your research.
